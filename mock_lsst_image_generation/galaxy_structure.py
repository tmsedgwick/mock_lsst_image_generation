"""Spiral arms, bars and irregular clumps for resolved discs, as light moved around within the catalogue's disc.

The disc's own light is redistributed by azimuthal Fourier modes in the disc plane (r, theta), so band fluxes are
unchanged:
    arms         1 + A [w(m (theta - ln(r / r0) / tan(pitch))) - 1], w = ((1 + cos) / 2)^k normalised to average 1
                 around each ring: m logarithmic spiral arms starting at r0
    bar          inside r0 the disc's light is flattened and gathered into an m = 2 mode lined up with where the arms
                 start, so the arms grow from the bar's ends
    irregular    random low-order modes with a radial twist (lopsided, clumpy light)
The disc is 3D (Gaussian vertical profile, scale height DISC_THICKNESS x the scale length) and seen at the inclination
its catalogue axis ratio implies, via the exact line-of-sight projection
    (1 / cos i) integral of Sigma(x, (y + z sin i) / cos i) f(z) dz          (x along the major axis)
done by Gauss-Hermite quadrature. The result is two images per unit disc flux, each summing to zero: the bar part
(the disc's colours) and the arm / clump part (bluer: scaled per band by ARM_COLOUR_BOOST). GalSim's smooth disc
stays as it is; these images are added on top of its stamp, convolved with the same Gaussian PSF.
